**QuickCart** is a full-featured e-commerce web application built with the React + Spring Boot.This is a robust product filtering and order management system with two separate user roles: customer and seller. Customers can search, filter, and order products, while sellers can upload products, accept or reject orders, and monitor sales. The app includes custom DSA algorithms (QuickSort, Binary Search, HashMap, Trie) to optimize filtering and search.
